    <h1>Self-Balancing Robot</h1>
    
    <h2>Control Systems & Mathematical Modeling</h2>
    <p>Developed dynamic equations of motion using Lagrangian mechanics.
        Derived state-space representations and linearized the nonlinear system.
        Designed and tuned a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for optimal balance and disturbance rejection.</p>
    
    <h2>Embedded Systems & Real-Time Control</h2>
    <p>Implemented control on an STM32 microcontroller (STM446RE).
        Processed real-time sensor data from an MPU6050 IMU.
        Used PWM-based motor control to adjust motor torque dynamically</p>
    
    <h2>Signal Processing & Estimation</h2>
    <p>Applied a Kalman filter for sensor data fusion to reduce noise.
        Analyzed IMU sensor noise and integrated accelerometer/gyroscope data.</p>
        <h2>Hardware Development & PCB Design</h2>
        <p>Designed and assembled a custom PCB for motor drivers and sensors.
            Integrated DC motors with encoders for position and velocity feedback.
            Built and tested a 3D-printed robot chassis, optimizing weight and center of gravity.</p>
            <h2>Software Development & System Integration</h2>
            <p>Developed a software framework in C for the STM32.
                Designed a data logging system for IMU readings and motor responses.
                Implemented planned Bluetooth communication for external control.</p>
                <h2>Simulation & Validation</h2>
<p>Simulated robot dynamics and control response in MATLAB/Simulink.
    Compared theoretical and simulated results for performance validation.
    Attempted real-world hardware validation (though PCB errors prevented full execution).</p>
